	>>> nextNoteTime calculation
need to calculate it based off of the notesToPlay
!! currently just upping it every interval tick by an amount greater than the interval so that it eventually stops playback, lol

what parameters do i need to calculate it?
	> know when the next beat is to be played
		> NEXT beat, i.e. gotta check currentBeat + 1 
	> calculate that beat in time
		> try ctxTime plus 

how do i calculate nextNoteTime?
	> at beat 1, i want nextNoteTime to be 0, play right away
	> at beat 2, i want nextNoteTime to be audioTime plus beatDuration

how should it work in theory?
	> setTimeout call, ask if a note is to be played
		> know when the note should be played

advancing nextnote isnt enough to falsify the playEngine block:
	> nextNoteTime < audioTime() + scheduleAheadTime 
	> 58.741 < ? 58.913 
	> one scheduleAheadTime later => (250ms/3) = 83ms
	> nextNoteTime += beatDuration => 250ms
	> 58.991 < ? 59.003
	> here we see that 90ms later, i.e. 83 and change (7ms accounted for by slow JS thread), the next possible eighth note time is still <, so it plays twice

	? my algorithm is wack. mb needs an overhaul

redo notesToPlay:
	notesToPlay: {
		beat-1 : {
			note-1 : {
				chords: 1,
				melody: 1
			}
		}
	}

interval (unsure of order):
	> nextNote null
	> e.g. at currentBeat 4, ask if beat 5 has a note to be played
		> if so, schedule the note. 
			> calculate nextNoteTime, send it to playEngine

16th box click creates an invalid 17th:

	> clicking on the right most, it adds one to the array

TRY:
	> schedule based on current + 1, what do we get?
	> keep track of every tick of an eighth note as well as every tick of the interval. if its 3 intervals per eighth note, only tick eighth note time up after 3 are achieved. use the same variable, % 3 it to know when to tick eighth note count.

			> theres a gap between audioTimea and timeFromStart, mb due to setTimeout lag
		> currently hve nextNoteTime being < audioTime, when it should be IN the window, not super below it

ctxTime + scheduleAheadTime create a window
	> ctxTime->[         ]<-scheduleAheadTime
	> they each define the boundaries of the window
	> if nextNote falls within, schedule it

chain of functions:
	if playing
		> setInterval() (scheduleBeat each interval)
			> scheduleBeat() asks notesToPlay what's going on
				> if nextNoteTime < audioTime() + scheduleAheadTime
					> playEngine()
				> then advanceCurrentBeat()
					try to keep it just advancing, dassit

edge case:
	> on beat 1, nextNoteTime is 0. if it exists, it should play due to my if condition && checking if beat-1 exists one noteToPlay before passing to playEngine()
	> on last beat (e.g. 16), ensure that beat 1 will be scheduled


OK SO THAT WAS JUST FOR NEXTNOTETIME
NOW I WANT TO TRY TO MAKE SLIDERS LESS PAINFUL FOR REACT
	IDEAS: 
		> DEBOUNCE (tried, idk if it really works especially w react)
		> ONLY SET STATE UPON DRAGGING BECOMING FALSE
		> MAKE JS UPDATE THE UI WITHOUT CHANGING STATE


so if i wanna do the latter, how to?
	> almost like making it no longer a react component tied to state cuz thats the whole thing about react.. you can update the UI very faithfully
		> would i thus be unable to track the fill of the slider and update it ?

maybe i can make parameters more efficient by putting dragging down further into child components??
	> no. i mean, it wasnt the fix i wanted. all of the sliders rerender every move because just one of those state badboys exists in Parameters.js and if it changes then Parameters rerenders and thats that. its state changed
		> mb the answer is figuring out a workaround to have these things in const, not state

my main issue is that parameters.js contains the state that we then send down to the children. i wish there was a way only that child would update but im not sure thats possible. 

NOW IMA TRY TO REMOVE ARExBEATS FROM STATE AND JUST DEPEND ON CHECKED IN THE FURTHEST CHILD

> doenst work cuz state is king
	> REMEMBER to revisit the functionality of all the setAreMelody and setAreChords and setNotesToPlay you commented out
	> since im not returning anything from handleNoteClick, areXBeats and notesToPlay do not persist in their changes in the rest of the app, thus nothing plays.
		> at this point, i should decide which to keep. it seems more elegant to keep notesToPlay as it is one fine object, doesn't have tons of zero fluff. it also is already integrated with nextNoteTime.
		> can i actually get rid of both areMelodyBeats and areChordBeats?? wow! they've been with me since the beginning.. i cant throw away old friends like that!
> can i avoid sending notesToPlay state down to SingleCheckbox while still having it use the helper to update it?
	> prop drill handleNoteClick, remove it from Helpers so we can access notesToPlay directly without having to pass it from SingleCheckbox
	> what will this achieve? we update notesToPlay state, meaning we can play notes, but it isnt a dependency for the children (not passed as a prop) and thus doesn't trigger a re-render of the entire grid. 
	> ok, so remove handleNoteClick from SingleCheck
	> take out of Helpers.js
		> actually, you can keep it there, just call it from Sequencer and pass it notesToPlay
	> integrate into Sequencer.js
		> need 3 infos from SingleCheckbox: scaleIndex, beatNum, and type. i wont have these in Sequencer, so i must pass them back via a function

		>V send 3 infos to sequencer, toggle checked on checkbox
		>V send these plus notesToPlay to Helper

INTERESTING, INTERESTING!!
	> by re-rendering and thus re-defining my function, bubbleUpCheckBoxInfo technically gets viewed as a changing prop, thus triggering re-renders. in order to fix this, we can store the function in between renders using the useCallback react hook. 
	> we fix the useCallback issue, but we have to update useCallback by having a dependency array containing notesToPlay or else it doesn't keep an up to date version of notesToPlay :<
		> imagine the state initialization as its own closure. once init'd, it keeps a snapshot of the state as it was then and will not change unless included in the dependency array, thus causing a re-render
	> maybe i could just send back the beatNum, scaleIndex, whichGrid and set them in state in Sequencer so that i can handle checkbox willynilly
		> this still requires useCallback since we're init'ing bubbleUp.. in Sequencer.js
		> should i make another piece of state, put a useEffect on it, that useEffect updates notesToPlay? this is a lot of workaround, but it might be worth it for performance reasons...

for bubblin:
	> either some convoluted thing sending beatNum scaleIndex to the handleNoteClick helper, or set state and a useEffect watching for that state
		> recursive useCallbacks is dumb. just do one useCallback for bubbleUp, set state in sequencer, then call helper based off that state change
	> SUCCESS! what did i do?
		> bubbleUp useCallback: receive important info from SingleCheckbox, set this info in state called clickedNote
		> use this new state and send it to handleNoteClick helper which updates notesToPlay
			> put this in a useEffect so that it only sends when clickedNote state changes
				> had to add an if (clickedNote.whichGrid) because it was sending an empty note click upon render

now to fix parameters re-rendering:
	> slidersToShowObj needs to be in state because react thinks its changing every time
		> changing it to state, we can see render time from clicking one checkbox go from 12-13ms to about 6-8ms, i.e. 33% improvement in render time. This was in an enormous, crappy copy pasted slidersToShowObj into a big ugly state and call it a day
	> mb deconstruct slidersToShowObj, make the static parameters an import
		> this must fix the problem of re-rendering thinking something is new. its not. if it fails, its gotta be state
		> if i have my big slidersState, are stateValue and setParameterState pointing to memory or taking a snapshot?
		> i know that react doesn't like big crazy nested state
	> ALT: possible to make a generic slider state within the slider itself and bubble it back, sending it to the engine
		> make a parameters object that we then send to the engine, clean++
			> TODO:

sendChordPattern:

		> change map, if < chordInputStep || > chordInputStep + pattern.length

		> no, actually. i set up an infinite loop by setting a state on checked, this causing a rerender of the singleCheckbox, then it kept the same prop values whereupon it asked again 'does the sent pattern exist', which was still tre, so it set state again on checked. i needed to verify that checked was now indeed true and then NOT set state any more.
