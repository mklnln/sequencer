bugs

sometimes the playback will stop due to the variable 'now' being at value of 0. this is audioContext.currentTime, so it should very much keep going
    -> changing filter parameter makes audioContext reset
    -> THEORY: this is due to too many audioContexts being created.
        -> issue disappears when i audioContext.close() after a parameter change. however, this stops current playback and restarts once i stop changing parameter. fixed by close() after 1000ms timeout, but sounds taking longer than 1000ms would get cut out. changed it to 5000ms.

s short cut doesn't start playback
    -> didnt change anything except add console.logs to see when event listeners are put in and taken away, now it works. ???
    -> pressing another key will 

to-do
    -> can i make the filter value logarithmic? there's more interesting sounds happening in the lower end between 100 and 3k but from 5k to 11k it barely does anything, yet 100-3k takes only 1/4 the space
    -> nice knobs. use https://g200kg.github.io/input-knobs/
        -> visual bug. fixed by removing a value of 1.6 from ik.frameheight
            -> "0px " + -((v * ik.sprites) | 0) * (ik.frameheight - 1.6) + "px"
                -> tried again after fixing it. the issue is back. i removed it, it's somehow not an issue at all anymore? ok.
        -> mb try https://github.com/g200kg/webaudio-controls instead?
    -> knob values are set by react but not keeping up with those in input-knobs.js
        -> integrate react into input-knobs? we have DOM elements and event listeners
